### Video usage and consumption

There has been a noticeable uptick in video usage over the past three years. A few stats evidencing this include that video consumption on mobile devices rises a whopping 100 percent each year. In addition, 78 percent of people report watching videos online each week while 55 percent of those watch on a daily basis. More than half (54%) demand more video content on top of what they already consume. Viewers claim they retain 95 percent of a message when obtained via video and a significant 92 percent of mobile users report sharing videos with others. The vast majority of businesses are shifting their strategies accordingly with 81 percent incorporating the tactic into the plansâ€“a 63 percent increase year-over-year.

### Short-form video

Short-form videos continue to trend in 2021. The growth of Instagram reels and TikTok is living proof of that. Although these clips last about 15 seconds, they let brands communicate with the audience in a very exciting way thanks to their relevance and ambiance. Many of these videos go viral thanks to the unusual approach of adding memorable music that underlines the personality of a brand.
